<p>I thought about going insane today, a typical tuesday at home for me. still battling myself on chopping off my hair– there is a deeply rooted belief in me that it’ll set me free. I hope one day i find out if that’s true or not. I doodled too, in the midsts of my insanity, listening to how charlie xcx became the popstar she is today. a backstory like hers is something i will never have. you can tell when someone’s rooted in mystical lore, it makes you special. i am forever chasing special. i wanted to shatter my wineglass overtop of my drawing on the ground but i thought that roomie might not like that once she gets home. and red wine stains. im lazy and not dealing with that; but so was born another idea for an art project. thats where you come in- i no longer have an excuse to keep these thoughts hidden in my drawers, i have YOU to smother with them. so stay posted, there’s a lot more to come, I like to keep busy. enjoy the doodle &amp; you’ll hear from me soon.  –your exol</p>
